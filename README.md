This is an answer to a coding challenge.

The challenge was to find how many different ways the number 100 000
can be formed by summing two positive prime numbers.

To compile run
```
javac src/Goldbach.java
```

To run
```
javac -cp src Goldbach
```

The target sum can optionally be given as an argument
```
javac -cp src Goldbach 10000
```
